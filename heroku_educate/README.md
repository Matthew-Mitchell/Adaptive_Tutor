# edUcate BETA
Welcome to the directory of my primitive front end to the Adaptive Tutor project.

Here you will find source code written in HTML and FLASK that demonstrates limited functionality of the overall project. Functional limitations of the analysis and recommendation system need to be worked out to build a more developed front end. This is because unlike services like Netflix which may employ collaborative filtering once in a while to recommend Movies, the Adaptive Tutor must perform such calculations at more regular intervals in order to continue to meet the personalized needs of a student. Avoiding time lags on the front end is thus of specific concern I have that has yet to be worked out. Please feel free to fork the repository and run the demo locally. An online version hosted by Heroku is in the works.

Thanks again for stopping by!
