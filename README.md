# Adaptive_Tutor

Welcome to my Adaptive Tutor Project!
This project began after using DeltaMath.com for a number of years with my students. After leaving teaching, I decided to explore some of the data behind this wonderful site with the hopes of creating a tutor system that could continually update and adapt to the needs of the students it served. No longer will teachers assign a single problem set to the entire class, but rather specific learning experiences may be prescribed to meet the needs of each individual.

In this repository, you will find iPython Notebook scripts exploring a subset of 6 months worth of data, a beta app implementing a simplified version of these scripts, and a brief powerpoint presentation laying out the motivation and concept for the project.
